## Basic Queries

Skygear provides query of records with conditions. Here is a straight-forward
example of getting the note that has the `title` as `First note` inside the
public database. If you don't know the difference between
private database and public database, please read the
[Cloud Database Basics][doc-cloud-db-basics] section first.

``` javascript
const Note = skygear.Record.extend('note');
const query = new skygear.Query(Note);
query.equalTo('title', 'First note');
skygear.publicDB.query(query).then((notes) => {
  // notes is an array of Note records that has its "title" equals "First note"
}, (error) => {
  console.error(error);
});
```

You can make queries on [reserved columns][doc-reserved-columns] as well,
and of course you can put multiple conditions in the same query object:

``` javascript
const query = new skygear.Query(Note);
query.lessThan('order', 10);
query.equalTo('category', 'diary');
skygear.publicDB.query(query);
```

By default, the condition added to the query are combined with `AND`. To
construct an `OR` query, we need to specify it with the following syntax.

``` javascript
const likeQuery = new skygear.Query(Note);
likeQuery.greaterThan('like', 50);
const shareQuery = new skygear.Query(Note);
shareQuery.greaterThan('share', 10);
const query = skygear.Query.or(likeQuery, shareQuery);
query.equalTo('category', 'diary');
skygear.publicDB.query(query);
// SQL equivalent: (like > 50 OR share > 10) AND category = 'diary'
```

You can use `skygear.Query.not(query)` to get a condition negated version of `query`.


## Conditions

Conditions are like `WHERE` clause in SQL query and `filter` in NoSQL query.
You can certainly chain conditions together. Here is a list of simple
conditions you can apply on a query:

``` javascript
const query = new skygear.Query(Note)
  .equalTo('title', 'First note')
  .notEqualTo('category', 'dangerous')
  .lessThan('age', 10)
  .lessThanOrEqualTo('age', 10)
  .greaterThan('size', 50)
  .greaterThanOrEqualTo('size', 50);
```

### Contains condition

The `contains` condition can be used to query a key for value that matches one
of the items in a specified array. Suppose here we are querying for movies,
and each movie has exactly one genre.

``` javascript
query.contains('genre', ['science-fiction', 'adventure']);
query.notContains('genre', ['romance', 'horror']);
```

If the value is an array, the `containsValue` condition can be used to query for
a key that has an array as its value containing the specified value. Suppose
further that each movie has multiple tags as an array, for example
_Independence Day: Resurgence_ may have tags "extraterrestrial" and "war".

``` javascript
query.containsValue('tags', 'war');
query.notContainsValue('tags', 'hollywood');
// both matches our example movie
```

### Like condition

The `like` function can be used to query a key for complete or partial matches
of a specified string. The percent character (`%`) can be used in place
for any number of characters while the underscore (`_`) can be used in place
for a single character.

``` javascript
query.like('genre', 'science%'); // included: science, science-fiction, etc.
query.notLike('state', 'C_');    // excluded: CA, CO, CT, etc.
query.caseInsensitiveLike('month', '%a%');    // included: January, April, etc.
query.caseInsensitiveNotLike('actor', '%k%'); // excluded: Katy, Jack, etc.
```

### Having relation condition

The `havingRelation` condition can be used to query records whose owner or
creator has relationship with the current user. For example, you can use it
to query new posts made by users whom you are following.

``` javascript
query.havingRelation('_owner', skygear.relation.Following);
query.notHavingRelation('_owner', skygear.relation.Friend);
// records owned by following users but not friend users
```

See [Social Network][doc-social-network] section for more information.

### Geolocation condition

Please visit [Data Types: Location][doc-data-type-location] section for more.


## Pagination and Ordering

### Order of records

You can sort the records based on certain field in ascending or descending order.
You can also sort on multiple fields as well.

``` javascript
query.addAscending('age');    // sorted by age increasing order
query.addDescending('price'); // sorted by price decreasing order
```

The above query will first sort from small age to large age, and records
with the same age will be then sorted from high price to low price. Just like
this SQL statement: `ORDER BY age, price DESC`.

### Pagination of records

There are 3 settings that affect query pagination:
- `limit`: number of records per query/page (default value 50)
- `page`: which page of records to return (skip `page - 1` pages of records)
- `offset`: number of records to skip

You shall not set both `page` and `offset`, otherwise `page` will be ignored.

``` javascript
query.page = 3;
/* 101st to 150th records */
```

``` javascript
query.limit = 20;
query.offset = 140;
/* 141st to 160th records */
```

``` javascript
query.limit = 15;
query.page = 8;
/* 106th to 120th records */
```

## Counting records

To get the number of records matching a query, set the `overallCount`
of the Query to `true`.

``` javascript
query.overallCount = true;
skygear.publicDB.query(query).then((notes) => {
  console.log('%d records matching query.', notes.overallCount);
}, (error) => {
  console.error(error);
});
```

The count is not affected by the limit set on the query. So, if you only want
to get the count without fetching any records, simply set `query.limit = 0`.


## Relational Queries

This example shows how to query all notes (`Note` record) who has an `account` field reference to a user record. In this example, we will query all notes where `account` equals to the current user.


``` javascript
const Note = skygear.Record.extend('note');
let query = new skygear.Query(Note);
query.equalTo('account', new skygear.Reference(skygear.auth.currentUser));

skygear.publicDB.query(query).then((r) => {
    console.log(r);
});

```

If you haven't have the corresponding record in hand (in this example, we will use the User record `182654c9-d205-43aa-8e74-d465c830087a`), you can reference with a specify `id` without making another query in this way:

``` javascript
const Note = skygear.Record.extend('note');
let query = new skygear.Query(Note);
query.equalTo('account', new skygear.Reference({
    id: 'user/182654c9-d205-43aa-8e74-d465c830087a'
}));

skygear.publicDB.query(query).then((r) => {
    console.log(r);
});

```

### Eager Loading

If you have a record that with [reference][doc-data-type-reference] to
another record, you can perform eager loading using the transient syntax.
Here we have an example (notice that Delivery has reference to Address
on key `destination`):

``` javascript
const Delivery = skygear.Record.extend('delivery');
const Address = skygear.Record.extend('address');

const address = new Address({ /* some key-value pairs */ });
const delivery = new Delivery({ destination: new skygear.Reference(address) });
skygear.publicDB.save([address, delivery]);
```

Now if you want to query delivery together with the address:

``` javascript
const query = new skygear.Query(Delivery);
query.transientInclude('destination');
skygear.publicDB.query(query).then((records) => {
  console.log(records[0].destination);            // skygear.Reference object
  console.log(records[0].$transient.destination); // Address record object
}, (error) => {
  console.error(error);
});
```

You can also set an alias for transient-included field.

``` javascript
const query = new skygear.Query(Delivery);
query.transientInclude('destination', 'deliveryAddress');
skygear.publicDB.query(query).then((records) => {
  console.log(records[0].$transient.deliveryAddress); // Address record object
}, (error) => {
  console.log(error);
});
```

- It is possible to eager load records from multiple keys, but doing so
will impair performance
- If you have a record in the public database referencing a record in the
private database (or the other way around), `transientInclude` would fail
and give you `null` at the transient key. If you really need to do so, you
have to make another query.
